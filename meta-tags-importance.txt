Meta tags are pieces of code on a webpage that describe what the webpage is about.

Meta tags, sometimes referred to as metadata, include the title tag, meta description tag, and the keywords tag (although the meta keywords tag is now rarely used) and a few others.

Meta tags serve a key role in search engine optimization, including:

- Helping the search engines determine the topic of your webpage
- Helping people understand the contents of your webpage
- Avoiding duplicate content issues
- Driving clicks and organic search traffic
