File and Stream Handling:

- File and stream handling is a crucial aspect of Java programming, enabling the reading and writing of data to files. This involves understanding the different types of streams and how to effectively manage data flow.

Byte Streams and Character Streams:

- Byte streams handle input and output of 8-bit bytes. They are useful for binary data, such as image and audio files. The main classes are InputStream and OutputStream.
- Character streams handle input and output of 16-bit Unicode characters. They are useful for text data. The main classes are Reader and Writer.

Reading from and Writing to Files:

- Reading can be done using FileInputStream for bytes and FileReader for characters. Buffered classes (BufferedReader) are used for efficiency.
- Writing can be done using FileOutputStream for bytes and FileWriter for characters. Buffered classes (BufferedWriter) are used for efficiency.

BufferedReader and BufferedWriter:

-BufferedReader and BufferedWriter provide buffering for efficient reading and writing of characters, arrays, and lines. They are wrapped around Reader and Writer objects.
- BufferedReader: Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters to provide efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
- BufferedWriter: Writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters to provide efficient writing of characters, arrays, and lines.
